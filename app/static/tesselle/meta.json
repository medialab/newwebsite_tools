It allows to comment on specific parts of photographs, maps, or visualizations, in order to perform precise visual analysis and inquiry-driven arguments. Tesselle also embeds a tiling feature which allows to seamlessly display and navigate very large images on the web. Eventually, Tesselle allows to export your work as a simple folder to publish anywhere on the web.",
